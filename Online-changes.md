# Test-repo1
Just checking how to work with repos on/offline

change #1. Starting up

change #4. Final change because I think I have ascertained every (not-so-basic) thing I needed to so far.

---

change #5. And now let's try all the same on another machine. And test cyrillic letters into the mix. Тестовое сообщение №1.

change #7. Curuioser and curiouser. Pushing project back worked. Cyrillic message typed into the .md file on the computer is not quite so Cyrillic after the push, either. Cyrillic description of changes typed in Git Bash... is Cyrillic despite the console's (?) warning it may not be. The first Cyrillic message (in line 10 this file) that did not look Cyrillic on the PC looks Cyrillic after being pushed back online. M'kay.
